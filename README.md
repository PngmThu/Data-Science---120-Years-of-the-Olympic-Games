# Data-Science---120-Years-of-the-Olympic-Games
This is a data science project to explore "120 Years of the Olympic Games" dataset from Kaggle. To start, we do some data exploration to understand more about features and also missing values of the data. Our first question is whether home team advantage has a great impact on the number of medals and the win rate of that home team. Then, we figure out and prove it by an impressive Plotly visualization. The second part is training data and making prediction for the type of medal for each athletic. We use 3 models: neural network with Pytorch, classification tree and Naive Bayes algorithm. All of them finally end up with around 85% accuracy. Our final result is a function for users to input parameters of a specific athletic to see which kind of medal he/she will win.
## Getting Started
You have to download "athlete_events.csv" from Kaggle (because its size is too big so we cannot upload it)
